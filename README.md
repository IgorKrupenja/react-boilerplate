# React boilerplate

This just a small React starter boilerplate I use for personal projects. Yes, [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is awesome but I wanted to create something with a bit more functionality, especially Firebase support.

## Usage

`git clone git@github.com:igor-krupenja/react-boilerplate.git; rm -rf react-boilerplate/.git`

This will clone the repo and remove `.git` folder so that the folder can be initialised as a new project.

## Highlights

- Support `.env` files for separate development and production configurations
- Core Redux config
- Built-in Firebase config with a couple helper functions and working Firebase Auth example (uses Redux)
- React Router support
- Webpack dev server with HMR for CSS and React components
- SCSS and SVG support
- React Bootstrap support
